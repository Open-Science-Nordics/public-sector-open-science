## Scientific Computations

- FP - Functional Programming - focus on VERBs not NOUNs, less of side-effects and state contrasting with Object Oriented paradigm where focus is on NOUNs not VERBs and the data and algorithms often carries a lot of state and side-effects of one method to other objects in the system are often plenty and difficult to control and understand
- Well geared fo executing computations in parallel at scale

## Biodiversity Analysis

- More than just computations - the whole narrative
- Involves several reproducible steps:
	- processing data from different sources
	- modelling (computations)
	- presenting results, enabling peer-review to build trust in results

## Modus Operandum
	
- Reproducible Open Research

## Open Source Toolbox

- Docker - for running anything anywhere
- ROpenSci-packages - for Biodiversity Analysis tools
- OpenCPU - for exposing data as a service
- Shiny - for providing a web based interactive user interface
